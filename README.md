# Data-on-the-go

## what it contains

This file contains the code to my "Aibidia data on the go" app.
The app is supposed to allow clients to have immediate acces to an overview of their data.
Even when they are not at the office or near their laptop.

## User Story

Getting started:
Opening the AIBIDIA App the first thing to do is log in. For that two fields and a button
appear. One to fill in your username and the second one to fill in your password. Underneath 
the fields there is the submit button to continue. 
If the password is correct the home page appears. 

Logged in:
The first page that opens is HOME. This page shows an overview on the latest changes in the 
chartâ€™s information.  At the top right corner there are two icons. One for the SETTINGS and 
another one to LOG OUT. On the footer a bar chart icon corresponding to the ANALYTICS, a 
clipboard icon for the DATA and a question mark icon for the WORLD TAX GUIDE section are shown. 

Settings:
By going to settings, the customer can set up their preferences in sorting the charts and maps.
Being in alphabetical order or by date of last changed.
Language, username and password can also be changed in settings.

Data:
By clicking the clipboard icon, the Data page is opened. This page contains the TP attributes and 
the arms length validation overview. By clicking on each on further information is opened.

Analytics:
Once the bar chart icon is clicked one opens the analytics page. This page contains the group 
analytics, legal entity analytics and the audit probability. Again, by clicking on each one further
information can be viewed.

Question mark:
The question mark icon leads to the world tax guide. In the world tax guide page a user can search 
for any countries current tax laws.

Log out:
To log out one must either go to the home side and click on the log out button or close the app.
